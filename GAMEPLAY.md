# World war Z Gameplay description

## Introduction
World War Z is a survival game where your goal is to survive zombie hordes trying to kill you. Your only tool in this mission is your trusty revolver.
Good luck staying alive!

## Rules
 - Your revolver is slow. You have to manually recharge it everytime, be careful to not run out of bullets!
 - You have godly aim, you always hit the head. Zombies always die with one shot!
 - You're an athlete you can always outrun zombies. Run for your life!
 - Zombies are really strong. They kill by just touching you, don't let them get too close! 

## Game modes
The game counts with two game modes:
 - Endless
Survive for as long as possible, this mode has no time and ammunition limit, however, the more zombies you kill and the more you stay alive, the harder it gets.

 - Competitive
Wreak havoc! The amount of zombies you face in this mode is insane, you also have a limited number of ammunition. Eliminate the greatest number of wankers before they overwhelm you.
